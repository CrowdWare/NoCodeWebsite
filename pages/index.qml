##Vision

The original idea behind NoCode was to create interactive eBooks that not only integrate videos, sound, and interactions but also incorporate 3D animations for tutorials, for example.
From this idea, a new way of software development and distribution has emerged.
We use the technology we are familiar with from websites and embed it into native applications.
And we do this on every platform.

###The End of Browser Wars

If youâ€™ve been around as long as our founder, you know the issues that unfortunately still persist today.
Back then, just like now, there were many different browsers.
Every major company was eager to make its browser the standard. So we had Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and others.
So far, none have prevailed, and as a programmer, you feel it, as you had to support all browsers, which often made the source code look quite chaotic."

Currently, the full range of features is not yet available, but you can already create an app for Android in a simple way,
without any programming knowledge, without having to compile the app, and without the hassle of publishing the app in the Play Store.

Just write a bit of XML (later there will also be a drag-and-drop designer), preview the app, try it out interactively, and publish it.

The app is instantly available online, and you and anyone else to whom you send the corresponding link can admire and work with this app using NoCodeBrowser."

# Roadmap
- 2024 Launch of the NoCodeDesigner for MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Web
- 2024 Launch of the NoCodeBrowser for Android
- 2025 Launch of the NoCodeBrowser for iOS

## NoCodeDesigner
- Drag-and-drop design panel
- Plugins for REST database access (so you can access any data source)
- Plugins for e-commerce systems (create your own shop)
- Plugins for payment functions (allow your customers to make purchases in the app)
- Plugin for 3D scenes (e.g., for interactive tutorials)
- One-click deployment of an app as .APK (Android) and .IPA (iOS) (can then be published in the App Store or Play Store, with your own App ID)

## Feedback
Your feedback is crucial for all these features, as we only want to integrate what our customers truly want.  
We will introduce a feature rating system where you can suggest new features, and other users can vote for them.  
Features that are most requested by customers will be prioritized for development and implementation.

# Funding
When we founded CrowdWare, we set ourselves the goal of providing custom software at very affordable prices and as open source.  
The idea for this project is also to first design a prototype, then raise development costs through crowdfunding, and finally complete the product.  
Sometimes, as in this case, we also skip a step.  

We have decided to provide a functional solution first and then finance further development through crowdfunding.  
If you understand the idea behind NoCode and recognize the potential it holds, I invite you to support the project.

## Crowdfunding
In the crowdfunding campaign, we want to finance the development costs that have already been incurred as well as those that will arise.  
If the funding goes through, we can bring the product to market for free, benefiting every future user.  
Since we have ongoing costs and also want to fund other projects, we will offer a commercial option in addition to the free version.

However, even the commercial offering will be significantly cheaper than that of our competitors, as we operate as a nonprofit and are not interested in profit.
